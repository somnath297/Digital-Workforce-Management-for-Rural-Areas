## 📌 Project Overview
**Digital Workforce Management System** is a desktop-based application designed to organize the unorganized skilled labor sector in rural India. It acts as a bridge between skilled daily wagers (Electricians, Plumbers, Carpenters) and local villagers who need their services.

The system eliminates middlemen, ensures transparent pricing, and provides a digital identity to rural workers using a simple and intuitive interface.
